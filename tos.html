      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Last updated: December 2025</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
      <p>
        By inviting <strong>Funky Gambling</strong> to your Discord server or using any of its commands,
        you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, remove the bot from
        your server and stop using it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Intended use</h2>
      <p>
        Funky Gambling is designed for entertainment and light moderation features:
        leveling, simple gambling with virtual tokens, and basic bad-word filtering.
        It must not be used for harassment, hate, or any illegal activities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. User responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for how the bot is used in your server.</li>
        <li>You must comply with all applicable laws and Discord&apos;s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</li>
        <li>You must not use the bot to store or distribute illegal, harmful, or adult content.</li>
        <li>You must not attempt to break, reverse-engineer, or abuse the bot or its systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Moderators &amp; permissions</h2>
      <p>
        Certain commands (such as <code>fumo setup</code>, <code>fumo cwl true/false</code>,
        and <code>fumo level popup true/false</code>) are restricted to users with moderation
        permissions (for example, Manage Server or Manage Messages). Server owners are responsible
        for who receives those permissions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Virtual currency &amp; gambling</h2>
      <p>
        Funky Gambling includes gambling-style commands that use an in-bot virtual currency.
        This currency has <strong>no real-world value</strong> and cannot be bought, sold,
        or exchanged for money or goods. The bot is provided for fun only.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Availability &amp; changes</h2>
      <p>
        The bot is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis. Features may be added,
        changed, or removed at any time without prior notice. There is no guarantee of uptime.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        The bot owner may restrict, suspend, or block Funky Gambling from any server or user at any time,
        particularly in cases of abuse, ToS violations, or attempts to break the bot.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about these Terms, or wish to report abuse related to Funky Gambling,
        please contact the bot owner via Discord.
